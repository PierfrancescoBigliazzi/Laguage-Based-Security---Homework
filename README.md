Language Based Technology for Security

This  course  introduces  and  surveys  the  field  of  Language-based  Software Security, in which techniques from compilers and programming language theory are leveraged to address issues in computer security. Topics include:

•Security in the Software Development Life Cycle
•The science of software security
•Memory-corruption flaws
•Control Flow Integry & Software Fault Isolation
•Safe Programming Languages
•Access Control, Sand-Boxing and Stack Inspection
•Inline-Reference Monitor (Theory & Sperimentation)
•Function as a Service
•Local Security Policies in Java
•Taint analysis•Information Flow
•Control Flow Analysis for Security
•Secure Compilation

The aim of the course is to allow each student to develop a solid understanding of the topics above, along with a more general familiarity with the range of research in the field. In-course discussion will highlight opportunities for cutting-edge research.
